This is a Julia wrapper for [L-BFGS-B Nonlinear Optimization Code](http://users.iems.northwestern.edu/%7Enocedal/lbfgsb.html).
It will use and download pre-compiled binaries from [L-BFGS-B-Builder](https://github.com/Gnimuc/L-BFGS-B-Builder).
Currently, this package only wraps a low-level subroutine `setulb`, no additional helper functions are provided, but you could take the driver in the `test` folder as an example.

## Installation
```julia
Pkg.add("LBFGSB")
```
